# What we learned
- Why tests in software developement are useful
- How to generate tests using Randoop

## Conclusion
Writing tests is important for software developers, but difficult and time-consuming. Using tools such as Randoop which automatically generates unit tests for Java classes reduces the lifecycle software development. Randoop has had many successful applications, especially with library classes (such as java.util). Randoop is used at companies like ABB and Microsoft, and on open-source projects.
