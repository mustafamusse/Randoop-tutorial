Why testing is important in DevOps
Using test automation, DevOps can: Use test cases to detect bugs and save time. Unlike manual testing, automatic test cases make testing faster, which means you can deploy products to market more quickly. Use software programs to test applications and minimize the chance of human error.

Writing tests is important, but difficult and time-consuming. Randoop automatically generates unit tests for Java classes. Randoop has had many successful applications, especially with library classes (such as java.util). Randoop is used at companies like ABB and Microsoft, and on open-source projects.
