# What we learned
- Why tests in software developement are useful
- How to generate tests using randoop

## Conclusion
Writing tests is important, but difficult and time-consuming. Randoop automatically generates unit tests for Java classes. Randoop has had many successful applications, especially with library classes (such as java.util). Randoop is used at companies like ABB and Microsoft, and on open-source projects.
