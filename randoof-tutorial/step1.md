# Why is testing important?
Testing is the identification and subsequent removal of the errors. However, testing also helps developers and testers to compare actual and expected results in order to improve quality. If the software production happens without testing it, it could be useless or sometimes dangerous for customers.

Creating tests is a difficult, time-consuming process requires technical sophistication and proper planning. Testers must not only have good development skills—testing often requires a great deal of coding—but also be knowledgeable in formal languages, graph theory, and algorithms.

## Using test automation
Using test automations, devops can use test cases to detect bugs and save time. Unlike manual testing, automatic test cases make testing faster, which means you can deploy products to market more quickly. Use software programs to test applications and minimize the chance of human error.

# Randoop
Randoop generates unit tests using feedback-directed random test generation. This technique pseudo-randomly, but smartly, generates sequences of method/constructor invocations for the classes under test. Randoop executes the sequences it creates, using the results of the execution to create assertions that capture the behavior of your program. Randoop creates tests from the code sequences and assertions.

Randoop can be used for two purposes:  
1) to find bugs in your program  
2) to create regression tests to warn you if you change your program's behavior in the future.

Randoop creates large numbers of tests that may be too complicated or too mundane for the average programmer to write. Randoop runs automatically. The user can tune parameters and provide optional inputs to improve Randoop’s performance.
